{"name":"Scholarly value-","tagline":"collections pages scholarly value","body":"# I’ve come up with three issues to validate the scholarly value of a digitized collection: \r\n\r\n# •\tWho cares? Active interest in contents as a collection\r\n# •\tWhat does creating a digital collection do for the scholars? At a minimum, it provides improved access and ease of use of materials that would otherwise not be easily accessible at Stanford. Having easy access to the materials themselves, the scholars provide the analysis and make them interesting.\r\n# •\tWhat can the scholars do with the materials? Providing new ways to access and contextualize the materials. Visualization: geographically, chronologically, by document format. Searching through metadata and, sometimes, full text. Bringing materials together in new ways, across formats, in smaller chunks of information. \r\n\r\n![BV](http://bv.stanford.edu/assets/laura-bassi-portrait-ffc47c1fdba7ed751866ca3c96acab11.jpg)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
